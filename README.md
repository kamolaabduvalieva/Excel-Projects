# Microsoft Excel - From Beginner to Advanced

Welcome to my Excel learning repository! üìä Here, I am sharing 6 real-world projects that helped me master Microsoft Excel from scratch. Most of these skills can also be applied to Google Sheets.

## What You Will Learn
In these projects, you will practice essential Excel skills, including:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Entering Data and Navigating Through a Spreadsheet
- Learn how to input and organize data in cells, rows, and columns.
- Understand basic navigation shortcuts to move efficiently within a spreadsheet.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Creating Formulas to Solve Problems
- Use basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /).
- Apply built-in functions like `SUM()`, `AVERAGE()`, and `IF()`.
- Understand relative vs absolute cell references (A1 vs $A$1).

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Creating Charts and Graphs
- Learn to visualize data using bar charts, line graphs, and pie charts.
- Customize colors, labels, and titles for better presentation.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Importing and Exporting Data

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Implementing VLOOKUP and Other Lookup Functions
- Use `VLOOKUP()` to search for values in large datasets.
- Learn `HLOOKUP()` and `INDEX-MATCH` as alternatives.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Using Pivot Tables for Data Analysis

## Project Files üìÇ
Each project is stored in its own folder, containing:
- The **Excel file (.xlsx/.xlsm)** with the project.
- A **README.md** file explaining the project details.
- Additional scripts if needed (e.g., VBA macros, Python, or SQL files).

## How to Use This Repository
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the Excel files and explore the formulas, charts, and pivot tables.
3. Follow along and try replicating the projects on your own!
